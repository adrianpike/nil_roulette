# NilRoulette

Tired of getting NoMethodErrors when you call a method on nil? Is it just too hard to figure out
what's really wrong? With ```nil_roulette```, those problems are a thing of the past!
```nil_roulette``` will fairly choose a recipient for an unknown method call and just pass the
buck. Who needs to know?

## Installation
